        <p class="text-white-50">In case if you still haven’t found what you’re looking for or just curious.</p>
        <p class="text-white-50">Can I use any kinds of headphones with my iPhone? </p>
        <p class="text-white-50"> Short answer is yes. However, depending whether or not your iPhone has a headphone jack or not, you may need to buy an adapter to use the Lightning port (charging port) as a headphone jack. You can also use bluetooth headphones and go completely wireless as well.</p>
        <p class="text-white-50">Does the iPhone 8 Plus have Animoji? </p>
